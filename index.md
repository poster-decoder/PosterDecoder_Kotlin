# Poster Decoder (Kotlin)

Android app aimed at mimicking Camscanner kind of applications.

#### User Stories

* *Capture Image*: User goes to an event and looks at various posters. He likes a poster and captures it on his phone. Now, when the app loads, he is allowed to load any image he wants to edit, or the app allows him to capture an image using his default camera app.
* *Select Image Boundary*: User is allowed to select the boundary of poster by putting his finger on the loaded image, dragging his finger and lifting it. Now he is shown the cropped image when he clicks on play button.

**NOTE**: We faced some integration issue because of which we couldn't show the other 2 user stories which we included in the prototype for our project.
